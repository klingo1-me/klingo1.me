Kling AI has just released Kling O1, a multimodal engine that accepts text, images, and video as inputs.

It supports a unified workflow for:

Generating new videos from scratch.

Transforming existing videos (video-to-video).

Complex editing tasks like object replacement, removing pedestrians, style transfer, and extending shots.
